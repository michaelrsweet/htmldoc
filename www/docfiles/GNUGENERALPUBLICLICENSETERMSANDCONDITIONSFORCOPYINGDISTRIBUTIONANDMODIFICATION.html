<H3><A NAME="10_1_2">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<BR> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H3>
<OL START="0">
<LI>This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
 notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
 the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
 covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
 (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
 is true depends on what the Program does.</P>
</LI>
<LI>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
 code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
 and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
 and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
 this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
 recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
 Program.
<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</P>
</LI>
<LI>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
 it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
 such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
 that you also meet all of these conditions:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
 that you changed the files and the date of any change.</LI>
<LI>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
 whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
 thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
 under the terms of this License.</LI>
<LI>if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when
 run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use
 in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including
 an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
 (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
 redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user
 how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself
 is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your
 work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</LI>
</OL>
<P>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.</P>
<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Program.</P>
<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
 Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
 volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
 work under the scope of this License.</P>
</LI>
<LI>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
 under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
 Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<OL TYPE="a">
<LI>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
 code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</LI>
<LI>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
 to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
 physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable
 copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the
 terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
 software interchange; or,</LI>
<LI>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
 distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
 for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
 object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
 Subsection b above.)</LI>
</OL>
<P>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
 code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
 associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
 compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
 exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
 is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
 major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
 on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.</P>
<P>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
 access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access
 to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
 the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
 the source along with the object code.</P>
</LI>
<LI>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
 to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
 automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
 parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
 License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
 remain in full compliance.</LI>
<LI>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
 Program or works based on it.</LI>
<LI>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
 these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
 on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
 responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</LI>
<LI>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
 would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
 those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
 only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
 entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.</P>
<P>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
 implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
 contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
 system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
 to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
 software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
 choice.</P>
<P>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.</P>
</LI>
<LI>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
 add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
 not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
 limitation as if written in the body of this License.</LI>
<LI>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
 to address new problems or concerns.
<P>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any
 later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
 number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.</P>
</LI>
<LI>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
 author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
 Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
 sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
 two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
 software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</LI>
