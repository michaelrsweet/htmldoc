CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.21

    NEW FEATURES

	- HTMLDOC now supports heading levels 1 to 15.
	- HTMLDOC now allows the author to omit headings from
	  the TOC using the _HD_OMIT_TOC attribute.

    CHANGES


    BUG FIXES

	- "make install" didn't work in the fonts directory.
	- "&euro;" didn't work, while "&#128;" did: the
	  character name table was not sorted properly...
	- Links didn't always point to the right page in PDF
	  output.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.20

    NEW FEATURES

	- New --nup and NUMBER-UP options for PostScript and PDF
	  output.
	- HTMLDOC now logs HTML errors.
	- HTMLDOC now supports the A3, B, Legal, and Tabloid
	  size names.
	- HTMLDOC now supports embedding of the base Type1 fonts
	  in PostScript and PDF output.

    CHANGES

	- The HTML parser now allows BODY to auto-close HEAD and
	  visa-versa.

    BUG FIXES

	- HTMLDOC wouldn't compile using GCC under HP-UX due to
	  a badly "fixed" system header file (vmtypes.h).
	- Generating a book without a table-of-contents would
	  produce a bad PDF file.
	- The Xerox XRX comments used the wrong units for the
	  media size, points instead of millimeters.
	- IMG elements with links that use the ALIGN attribute
	  didn't get the links.
	- Header and footer comments would interfere with the
	  top and bottom margin settings.
	- Fixed a bug in the htmlReadFile() function which
	  caused user-provided title pages not to be displayed
	  in PS or PDF output.
	- The table-of-contents would inherit the last media
	  settings in the document, but use the initial settings
	  when formatting.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.19

    NEW FEATURES

	- Now support the "subject" meta variable.

    CHANGES

	- Updated the HTML parser to use HTML 4.0 rules for
	  embedding elements inside a LI.
	- Now check for a TYPE attribute on EMBED elements, so
	  that embedded Flash files do not get treated as HTML.
	- Now put the COPYRIGHT meta data in the Author field in
	  a PDF file along with the AUTHOR meta data (if any).
	- No longer embed the prolog.ps command header when
	  PostScript commands are not being embedded in the
	  output.
	- HTMLDOC now properly ignores the HTML 4.0 COL element.

    BUG FIXES

	- Squeezed tables were not centered or right-aligned
	  properly.
	- Cells didn't align properly if they were the first
	  things on the page, or if there were several
	  intervening empty cells.
	- The preferred cell width handling didn't account for
	  the minimum cell width, which could cause some tables
	  to become too large.
	- Remote URLs didn't always resolve properly (like the
	  images from the Google web page...)
	- The font width loading code didn't force the
	  non-breaking space to have the same width as a regular
	  space.
	- PRE text didn't adjust the line height for the tallest
	  fragment in the line.
	- HTMLDOC tried to seek backwards when reading HTML
	  from the standard input.
	- The media margin comments did not work properly when
	  the current media orientation was landscape.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.18

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added support for remote HTML title pages.

    CHANGES

	- Now accept all JPEG files, even if they don't start
	  with an APPn marker.
	- Now only start a new page for a chapter/filter if we
	  aren't already at the top of a page.

    BUG FIXES

	- ROWSPAN handling in tables has been updated to match
	  the MSIE behavior, where the current rowspan is
	  reduced by the minimum rowspan in the table; that is,
	  if you use "ROWSPAN=17" for all cells in a row,
	  HTMLDOC now treats this as if you did not use ROWSPAN
	  at all.  It is unclear if this is what the W3C
	  intends.
	- The "--webpage" option didn't force toc levels to 0,
	  which caused a bad page object reference to be
	  inserted in the PDF output file.
	- Background colors in nested tables didn't always get
	  drawn in the right order, resulting in the wrong
	  colors showing through.
	- The HEADER page comment didn't set the correct top
	  position in landscape orientation.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.17

    NEW FEATURES

	- Improved table-of-contents generation, with chapter
	  headings at the top of new TOC pages and page numbers
	  based on the header/footer string.
	- Added new "--no-localfiles" option to disable access
	  to local files for added security in web services.
	- Long lines in book files can not be broken up using
	  a trailing backslash.
	- Added a modern "skin" to the GUI interface.

    CHANGES

	- Made some changes in how COLSPAN and ROWSPAN are
	  handled to better match how Netscape and MSIE format
	  things.
	- HTMLDOC now handles .book files with CR, LF, or CR LF
	  line endings.
	- Changed the TOC numbering to use 32-bit integers
	  instead of 8-bit integers...
	- Now handle local links with quoted (%HH) characters.
	- The command-line interface no longer sets PDF output
	  mode when using --continuous or --webpage.
	- HTMLDOC now opens HTML output files in binary mode to
	  prevent extra CR's under Windows, and strips incoming
	  CR's from PRE text.
	- Now support inserting the current chapter and heading
	  in the table-of-contents headers and footers.
	  
    BUG FIXES

	- The table cell border and background were offset by
	  the cellpadding when they should only be offset by the
	  cellspacing.
	- The buffer used for periods that lead up to the page
	  number in the table-of-contents was not large enough
	  for a legal-size document in landscape format.
	- If a book only contained chapter headings, the PDF
	  bookmarks would be missing the last chapter heading.
	- Table cells that ended with a break would render
	  incorrectly.
	- Fixed the table pre-format sizing code to properly
	  account for borders, padding, etc.
	- Fixed the table squeezing code to honor minimum widths
	  and properly resize the remaining space.
	- The MEDIA SIZE page comment did not reset the printable
	  width and length of the page.
	- Tables that used COLSPAN did not honor WIDTH values in
	  non-spanned cells.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.16

    CHANGES

	- Now break before and after DIV groups to match most
	  browsers (the HTML spec is ambivalent about it...)

    BUG FIXES

	- HR elements didn't render properly.
	- Background images didn't render properly and could
	  lock up HTMLDOC.
	- The "HALF PAGE" comment would lock up HTMLDOC -
	  HTMLDOC would keep adding pages until it ran out of
	  memory.
	- SUP and SUB used a fixed (reduced) size instead of
	  using a smaller size from the current one.
	- Empty cells could cause unnecessary vertical alignment
	  on the same row.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.15

    NEW FEATURES

	- Now support media source, type, and color attributes
	  in PS output.
	- Now support per-page size, margins, headers, footers,
	  orientation, and duplexing.
	- Now support plain text for headers and footers, with $
	  variables to include page numbers and so forth.
	- New device control prolog file for printer-specific
	  option commands.
	- Now support a new continuous web page mode that
	  doesn't automatically insert a page break with each
	  HTML file or URL (--continuous).
	- Now draw border around inline images as needed.
	- Now support MacOS X (only command-line at present).
	- Now support the "page-break-before", "text-align",
	  "vertical-align" style attributes, but only for style
	  information in an element's STYLE attribute.

    CHANGES

	- Now load images into memory only as needed, and unload
	  them when no longer needed.  This provides a dramatic
	  reduction in memory usage with files that contain a
	  lot of in-line images.
	- Now use the long names for the Flate and DCT filters
	  in all non-inline PDF streams.  This avoids a stupid
	  bug in Acrobat Reader when printing to PostScript
	  printers.
	- HTMLDOC now strips any trailing GET query information
	  when saving the start of files (target) in a document.
	- Unqualified URLs (no leading scheme name, e.g. http:)
	  now default to the HTTP port (80) instead of the IPP
	  port (631).
	- Optimized the image writing code to do more efficient
	  color searching.  This provides a significant speed
	  improvement when including images.
	- Now hide all text inside SCRIPT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA
	  elements.
	- OS/2 port changes from Alexander Mai.

    BUG FIXES

	- If a document started with a heading greater than H1,
	  HTMLDOC would crash.
	- Full justification would incorrectly be applied to
	  text ending with a break.
	- Images using ALIGN="MIDDLE" were not centered properly
	  on the baseline.
	- Table cells that used both ROWSPAN and COLSPAN did not
	  format properly (the colspan was lost after the first
	  row.)
	- Tables that used cells that exclusively used COLSPAN
	  did not format properly.
	- When writing HTML output, image references would
	  incorrectly be mapped using the current path.
	- Images with a width or height of 0 should not be
	  written to PS or PDF output.
	- The CreationDate comment in PostScript output
	  contained a bad timezone offset (+-0500, for example,
	  instead of -0500).
	- The PHP portal example now verifies that the URL
	  passed to it contains no illegal characters.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.14

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added support for 128-bit encryption.
	- Added support for GET form request data in the PHP and
	  Java "portal" examples.

    CHANGES

	- Most output generation limits have been removed;
	  HTMLDOC now dynamically allocates memory as needed for
	  pages, images, headings, and links.  This has the
	  happy side-effect of reducing the initial memory
	  footprint significantly.
	- Now call setlocale() when it is available to localize
	  the date and time in the output.
	- The table parsing code now checks to see that a
	  ROWSPAN attribute fits in the table; e.g., a ROWSPAN
	  of 10 for a table that has only 6 rows remaining needs
	  to be reduced to 6...

    BUG FIXES

	- Tables with a lot of COLSPANs could cause a divide-
	  by-zero error or bad pages (NAN instead of a number.)
	- Table cells with a single render element would not be
	  vertically aligned.
	- The --quiet option would enable progress messages on
	  the command-line.
	- Table cell widths could be computed incorrectly,
	  causing unnecessary wrapping.
	- The --path option disabled checking for the file
	  with the original filename.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.13

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added support for secure (https) URLs via the OpenSSL
	  library.
	- Added support for Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4).
	- Added support for transparency in PostScript and
	  PDF 1.1 and 1.2 output.
	- Added a --no-jpeg option (same as --jpeg=0)
	- Added support for the CSS2 page-break-before and
	  page-break-after properties.
	- Added a PHP example.

    CHANGES

	- External file references to non-PDF files now use the
	  "Launch" action so they can be opened/executed/saved
	  as allowed by the OS and PDF viewer.
	- Changed the indexed/JPEG'd transition point to 256
	  colors when using Flate compression.  This makes PDF
	  files much smaller in general.
	- Changed the in-line image size limit to 64k.
	- Now allow "<" followed by whitespace, "=", or "<". 
	  This violates the HTML specification, but we're sick
	  of people complaining about it.
	- Preferences are now stored in a user-specific file
	  under Windows, just like UNIX.  This provides
	  user-specific preferences and allows preferences to
	  be kept when upgrading to new versions of HTMLDOC.
	- The book loading code now allows for blank lines, even
	  though these are not a part of the format. (added to
	  support some scripted apps that include extra
	  newlines...)
	- Changed the leading space handling of blocks to more
	  closely match the standard browser behavior.

    BUG FIXES

	- The table formatting code adding the border width to
	  the cell width, while Netscape and MSIE don't.  This
	  caused some interesting formatting glitches...
	- The table formatting code didn't account for the
	  preferred width of colspan'd cells.
	- The table formatting code tried to enforce the
	  minimum cell width when squeezing a table to fit on
	  the page; this caused the table to still exceed the
	  width of the page.
	- The PDF catalog object could contain a reference to
	  a /Names object of "0 0 R", which is invalid.  This
	  would happen when the "--no-links" option was used.
	- Several HTML elements were incorrectly written with
	  closing tags.
	- When piping PDF output, the temporary file that is
	  created needed to be open for reading and writing,
	  but HTMLDOC only opened the file for writing.
	- Image links did not work.
	- The JPEG image loading code did not correctly handle
	  grayscale JPEG images.
	- JPEG images were not encrypted when writing a document
	  with encryption enabled.
	- The user password was not properly encrypted.
	- The colormap of indexed images were not encrypted when
	  writing a document with encryption enabled.
	- The temporary file creation and cleanup functions did
	  not use the same template under Windows, causing
	  multiple conversions to fail when temporary files were
	  used.
	- Paragraphs could end up with one extra text fragment,
	  causing the line to be too long.
	- The command-line program would clear the error count
	  after reading all the files/URLs on the command-line,
	  but before generating the document. If there were
	  problems reading the files/URLs, HTMLDOC would return
	  a 0 exit status instead of 1.
	- Image objects that were both JPEG and Flate compressed
	  would not display (filters specified in the wrong
	  order.)
	- Images with more than 256 colors would cause a
	  segfault on some systems.
	- Background images would generate the error message
	  "XObject 'Innn' is unknown".


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.12

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added new "--batch" option to convert HTMLDOC book
	  files from the command-line.
	- Added support for the "-display" option on systems
	  that use X11.
	- Now use image objects in PDF output for images when
	  the image width * height * depth > 32k.
	- Now use JPEG compression when the number of colors
	  would be > 32 colors or 16 gray shades.
	- True transparency support for GIF files in PDF 1.3
	  output!
	- The GUI now automatically changes the extension of the
	  output filename as needed.
	- The GUI now collects all error messages and shows them
	  once after the document is generated.
	- Added support for HSPACE and VSPACE attributes for images
	  with ALIGN="LEFT" or ALIGN="RIGHT".
	- Added new Java interface to HTMLDOC.

    CHANGES

	- Consolidated temporary file management into new
	  file_temp() function.  The new function also makes use
	  of the Windows "short lived" open option which may
	  improve performance with small temporary files.
	- Updated book file format and added an appendix
	  describing the format.
	- Now default to PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0) output format.
	- Now output length of PDF streams with the stream
	  object; this offers a modest reduction in file size.
	- The HTTP file cache now keeps track of previous URLs
	  that were downloaded.
	- The HTTP code now supports redirections (status codes
	  301 to 303) to alternate URLs.
	- Limit the height check for table rows to 1/8th of the
	  page length; this seems to provide fairly consistent
	  wrapping of tables without leaving huge expanses of
	  blank space at the bottom of pages.
	- The HTML output now also includes a font-family style
	  for PRE text; otherwise the body font would override
	  the PRE font with some browsers.
	- The snprintf/vsnprintf emulation functions were not
	  included in the HTMLDOC makefile.
	- RGB hex colors are now recognized with or without the
	  leading #.  This breaks HTML standards compliance but
	  should reduce the number of problem reports from buggy
	  HTML.
	- The stylesheet generated with the HTML output no longer
	  contains absolute font sizes, just the typefaces and
	  a relative size for SUB/SUP.
	- The title image is no longer scaled to 100% in the
	  HTML output.

    BUG FIXES

	- The web page output was not divided into chapters for
	  each input file.
	- The "make install" target did a clean.
	- The configure script would remove the image libraries
	  if you did not have FLTK installed.
	- The fix_filename() function didn't handle relative
	  URLs for images (e.g. SRC="../images/filename.gif")
	- Comments in the source document were being closed by
	  a </!--> tag in the HTML output.
	- The alignment attribute in TR elements was not inherited
	  by the TD and TH elements.
	- The HTML parser added whitespace before the title of a
	  document (missing check for TITLE element.)
	- The table formatter did not reset the column width when
	  a width was not specified explicitly.  This caused the
	  columns to be formatted with equal widths...
	- Paragraphs that didn't use the P element would use the
	  alignment attribute of the first fragment instead of the
	  parent.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.11

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added koi8-r character set.
	- Added new "TrueType" font option for PDF output. This
	  (hopefully) should improve support for non-latin
	  languages.
	- Added support for "justify" alignment; this is
	  currently implemented by adding additional space
	  between characters (no automatic hyphenation...)

    CHANGES

	- The "make install" target does a "make all" to ensure
	  that the software is built before installing it.  This
	  should help users that don't read the documentation
	  build the software.
	- Incorporated several OS/2 compile fixes from Alexander
	  Mai.
	- Tables that exceed the printable width of the page are
	  now squeezed to fit.

    BUG FIXES

	- The temporary file created for PDF output to stdout
	  was not unique.
	- The temporary file created for PDF output to stdout
	  did not use the GetTempPath() function under Windows.
	- The temporary file cleanup code did not use the
	  GetTempPath() function under Windows.
	- The prefs_load() function did not check the
	  HTMLDOC_DATA environment variable until after loading
	  the preferences file.  This could cause any saved
	  settings to generate error messages about missing
	  files (these were reloaded when the document data was
	  read, however.)
	- The first border for a table cell that spanned
	  multiple pages did not account for the cellpadding or
	  border width.
	- Leading whitespace was not eliminated in all cases.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.10

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "--quiet" option to suppress all messages sent to
	  stderr.
	- New chapter n/N page number format (:)
	- New "--links" and "--no-links" options for PDF output.
	- Added "&euro;" character name support.

    CHANGES

	- Documentation updates.
	- If a heading already contains a link, the name assigned for
	  the heading is stored in the existing link to avoid nested
	  links.
	- The table parsing code now also traverses THEAD and TFOOT
	  sections and handles multiple TBODY, THEAD, and TFOOT
	  sections.  The THEAD and TFOOT rows are treated as ordinary
	  rows.
	- Image alignment should now match W3C recommendations.
	- Newlines inside quoted values (e.g. SRC="filename\r\n")
	  are now ignored.
	- The STYLE data generated in HTML output now includes the
	  TYPE="text/css" attribute.

    BUG FIXES

	- The path support was still broken.
	- Embedded files and images did not use path or HTTP
	  support.
	- Table cell borders could be drawn on the wrong page
	  if not all cells in a row span more than one page.
	- Large images could end up covering the footer at the
	  bottom of the page (wasn't accounting for the line
	  spacing.)
	- Fixed some memory leaks that would affect Windows
	  95/98/Me users.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.9

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added a "--no-numbered" option to turn heading numbers
	  off.
	- Added support for "keywords" META data.
	- Added support for BMP images.
	- Added support for ROWSPAN attribute in tables.
	- Added support for HTTP file references.
	- Added new sample CGI program that can produce a PDF
	  file for any page on a server.
	- Added new n/N, date, and time formats for the header
	  and footer.

    CHANGES

	- Configuration script changes.
	- Now ignore file count in book files; instead, we now
	  look at the first character of the third and
	  subsequent lines - a dash (-) indicates the start of
	  the options. (use a backslash to quote filenames
	  starting with a dash)
	- Multiple-line paragraphs that have only 1 line on the
	  bottom of the current page are now started on the
	  following page.
	- DSC comments in PostScript output were not 100%
	  conformant with the DSC spec.
	- Long table-of-contents entries are now wrapped
	  (original patch supplied by Richard Pennington)
	- New color icon under UNIX when Xpm library available.

    BUG FIXES

	- Didn't allow &#nnn; character escapes inside
	  preformatted text.
	- Empty TBODY groups would cause parse_table() to
	  crash.
	- Comments were incorrectly terminated by ">" instead of
	  "-->".
	- The command-line and GUI interfaces looked for
	  "outlines" instead of "outline" for the page mode.
	- The HTML output code didn't output closing tags for
	  empty elements.
	- The GUI interface started with the compression
	  slider enabled, even for HTML output.
	- The beginnings of some lines could start with
	  whitespace.
	- Wasn't aligning images and text on lines based on the
	  line height.
	- The compression slider was enabled in the GUI even
	  though HTML output was selected.
	- The Perl example code was incorrect.
	- Fixed the check for whether or not pages were
	  generated.
	- htmlSetCharSet() wasn't reloading the character set
	  data if the data directory changed.
	- The GUI did not reset the default background color.
	- The 'C' page number style (chapter page numbers) started
	  at 3 instead of 1.
	- The chapter links were off by 1 or 2 pages when no title
	  page was included.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.8

    NEW FEATURES

	- Added support for PDF security/encryption!
	- Now support TABLE height attribute.
	- Now generate an error message if no pages are
	  generated (with a suggestion to use the webpage
	  option.)
	- New "paths" option to specify additional directories
	  to search for files.  This is useful when the source
	  files use absolute server paths.

    CHANGES

	- Added missing casts in htmllib.cxx that were causing a
	  compile warning with some compilers.
	- No longer draw borders around empty cells in tables..
	- Now disable the TOC tab when using webpage mode.
	- Now scale title image to 100% in HTML output.
	- Now handle comments with missing whitespace after the
	  "<!--".

    BUG FIXES

	- Nested tables didn't take into account the table
	  border width, spacing, or padding values.
	- HTMLDOC crashed under Solaris when reading HTML files
	  from the standard input.
	- <ELEM>text</ELEM> <MELE>text</MELE> was rendered
	  without an intervening space.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.7

    NEW FEATURES

	- The configure script now uses the local PNG, ZLIB,
	  and/or JPEG libraries when they are new enough.
	- The configure script now uses the -fno-rtti,
	  -fno-exceptions, and -fpermissive options as needed
	  with GCC (smaller, faster executables, works around X
	  header bugs in Solaris.)
	- Added a --toctitle option to set the table-of-contents
	  title from the command-line (was only available in the
	  GUI in previous releases...)
	- New "<!-- NEED amount -->" comment to force a page
	  feed if there is not sufficient room on the page for
	  the following text.
	- Page comments are now supported in tables.
	- Table rows are now allocated dynamically, MAX_ROWS at
	  a time.

    CHANGES

	- Increased default MAX_PAGES to 10000 (was 5000.)
	- File links in book files now point to the top of the
	  next page.
	- <TABLE ALIGN=xyz> now aligns the table (previously it
	  just set the default alignment of cells.)
	- Transparent GIFs now use the body color instead of white
	  for the transparent color.
	- Updated to LIBPNG 1.0.6 in source distribution.
	- Updated the default cellpadding to be 1 pixel to match
	  Netscape output.
	- Updated line and block spacing to match Netscape.
	- DL/DT/DD output now matches browsers (was indented from
	  browser output.)
	- Now only output link (A) style if it is set to "none".
	  Otherwise Netscape would underline all targets as well
	  as links.
	- Increased the MAX_COLUMNS constant to 200, and dropped
	  MAX_ROWS to 200. Note that the new table code now
	  allocates rows in increments of MAX_ROWS rows, so the
	  actual maximum number of rows depends on available
	  memory.

    BUG FIXES

	- Now ignore illegal HTML in tables.
	- The VALIGN code didn't handle empty cells properly.
	- Wasn't offsetting the start of each row by the cell
	  padding.
	- The JPEG image loading code didn't work for some JPEG
	  images, particularly those from digital cameras (JPEG
	  but not JFIF format.)
	- The strikethrough line was not being drawn in the
	  correct position.
	- Wasn't setting the height of BR elements, so <BR><BR>
	  didn't insert a blank line.
	- The table of contents would show the wrong page numbers
	  if no title page was generated.
	- Cell widths did not subtract any border, padding, or
	  spacing from the "preferred" width, causing formatting
	  differences between web browsers and HTMLDOC.
	- The PNG loading code did not handle interlacing or
	  transparency.
	- The HTML parsing code did not prevent elements in
	  embedded files from completing elements in the parent
	  file.
	- The table CELLSPACING amount was being applied twice in
	  the table sizing calculations.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.6

    NEW FEATURES

	- New linkcolor and linkstyle options.

    CHANGES

	- Minor source changes for OS/2 compilation.
	- SUP and SUB now raise/lower text more to be consistent with
	  browser look-n-feel.
	- Non-breaking space by itself was being output.  Now check for
	  that and ignore strings that consist entirely of whitespace.
	- New progress bar.

    BUG FIXES

	- Didn't add whitespace after a table caption.
	- Nested tables caused formatting problems (flatten_tree()
	  didn't insert breaks for new rows)
	- A cell whose minimum width exceeded the available width
	  for the table would cause the table to go off the page.
	- Cells that spanned more than two pages were drawn with boxes
	  around them rather than just the sides.
	- The stylesheet info in the HTML output specified the H1 size
	  for all headings.
	- The title page was incorrectly formatted when an image was
	  specified - the text start position was computed using the
	  pixel height of the title image and not the formatted height.
	- 1 color images didn't come out right; the "fix" to work around
	  an Acrobat Reader bug was being done too soon, so the color
	  lookups were wrong.
	- HTML file links now work properly.
	- Now limit all HTML input to the maximum size of input buffers
	  to avoid potential buffer overflow problems in CGIs.
	- If a row had a predefined height, HTMLDOC wasn't making sure
	  that the row would fit on the current page.
	- THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY caused problems when formatting tables.
	  Note: THEAD and TFOOT are *still* not supported, however the
	  code now properly ignores them and parses the rows in the
	  TBODY group.
	- The VALIGN code introduced in the 1.8.5 release didn't check
	  for NULL pointers in all cases.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.5

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "--titlefile" option to include an HTML file for
	  the title page(s).
	- New 'C' header/footer option to show current page
	  number within chapter or HTML file.
	- Allow adding of .book files to import all HTML files
	  in the book.
	- New "HALF PAGE" page comment to feed 1/2 page.
	- Added VALIGN and HEIGHT support in tables.

    CHANGES

	- Now optimize link objects in PDF files (provides a 40k
	  reduction in file size for the HTMLDOC manual alone)
	- Table rows that cross page boundaries are now rendered
	  more like Netscape and MSIE.
	- Now support HTMLDOC_DATA and HTMLDOC_HELP environment
	  variables under UNIX (for alternate install directory)
	- Now show error messages when HTMLDOC can't open the
	  AFM, character set, or PostScript glyph files.
	- The logo image is now scaled to its "natural" size (as
	  it would appear in a web browser)
	- Now recognize VALIGN="MIDDLE" or VALIGN="CENTER".

    BUG FIXES

	- Generation of PDF files to the standard output (i.e.
	  to the web server + browser) didn't work on some
	  versions of UNIX.  HTMLDOC now writes the PDF output
	  to a temporary file and then copies it to the standard
	  output as needed.
	- PDF links were missing the first 5 characters in the
	  filename; the code was trying to skip over the "file:"
	  prefix, but that prefix was already skipped elsewhere.
	- Nested descriptive lists (DL) did not get rendered
	  properly.
	- Tables had extra whitespace before and after them.
	- Multiple aligned images confused parse_paragraph();
	  the images would overlap instead of stack on the
	  sides.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.4

    CHANGES

	- More configure script changes for FLTK DSOs.
	- FileIcon.cxx was still using NULL for outline (an
	  integer), which caused some ANSI C++ compilers to
	  complain.

    BUG FIXES

	- The Fonts and Colors tab groups did not extend to
	  the full width of the tab area, which prevented the
	  Browse button from working when clicked on the right
	  side.
	- The help dialog window did not scroll all the way to
	  the bottom of the text.
	- The chapter ("c") header/footer string did not work.
	- The heading ("h") header/footer string did not always
	  match the first heading on a page.
	- The header and footer fonts were not used when
	  computing the widths of the header and footer strings.
	- The Windows distribution did not create the right
	  shortcut for the Users Manual in the Start menu.
	- The command-line code did not accept "--grayscale",
	  only "--gray"
	- Multi-file HTML output did not use the right link for
	  the table-of-contents file if no title page was being
	  generated.
	- Extra whitespace before and after tables has been
	  eliminated.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.3

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "--browserwidth" option to control scaling of images and
	  tables that use fixed pixel widths.

    CHANGES

	- The configure script now looks for the OpenGL library
	  (required if you use a shared FLTK library with OpenGL
	  support.)
	- Increased the max number of chapters to 1000.

    BUG FIXES

	- Page break comments didn't force a paragraph break.
	- --no-toc prevented chapters from being output in PS
	  and PDF files.
	- Filenames didn't always get updated properly when doing a
	  "save as"...
	- Fixed some more leading/trailing whitespace problems.
	- Wasn't freeing page headings after the document was
	  generated.
	- Wasn't range checking the current chapter number; now
	  limits the number of chapters to MAX_CHAPTERS and
	  issues an error message whenever the limit is exceeded.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.2

    NEW FEATURES

	- New "setup" program for UNIX software installation.

    CHANGES

	- Documentation updated for new UNIX "setup" program and
	  "..." usage for headers and footers.
	- Changed margins to floating point (instead of integer) to
	  improve table column accuracy.

    BUG FIXES

	- HTMLDOC could crash under Microsoft Windows with some
	  types of HTML files.  This was caused by a stack overflow,
	  usually when processing nested tables.
	- Multiple HTML files weren't being converted properly in
	  web page mode - only the last file would be generated for
	  PostScript output, and no file for PDF output.
	- Wasn't preserving the whitespace between "one" and "two"
	  in the HTML code "one<I> two</I> three".
	- Paragraph spacing was inconsistent.
	- <TABLE WIDTH="xx"> wasn't formatted properly.
	- The command-line code wasn't opening HTML files in binary
	  mode. This caused problems under Microsoft Windows.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8.1

    CHANGES

	- The configure script didn't update the ARFLAGS
	  variable for *BSD operating systems (no "s" option to
	  build the symbol table...)
	- Changed the installation commands to only create the
	  installation directory if it does not exist.  This
	  prevents installation errors on some platforms the
	  second time around.
	- Now use the Microsoft definitions for characters 128
	  through 159 that are otherwise unused by the
	  ISO-8859-x character sets.
	- Now set optimization settings when we know the compiler.	
	- Now always quote attribute values in HTML output to make
	  HTML lint programs happy.

    BUG FIXES

	- Wasn't using TOC title string in PDF document outline.
	- Preformatted text in tables didn't force the column
	  width.
	- Cells using COLSPAN > 1 didn't contribute to the width
	  of columns.
	- The table code didn't enforce the per-column minimums
	  under certain circumstances, causing "scrambled"
	  columns.
	- The configure script and makefiles didn't work when
	  FLTK was not available.  They now only build the "gui"
	  library when it is available.
	- The Windows distribution was installing files under
	  PROGRAMDIR instead of TARGETDIR.  This prevented users
	  from customizing the installation directory.
	- The configure script overrode the LDFLAGS environment
	  variable, preventing FLTK from being located in a non-
	  default directory.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.8

    NEW FEATURES

	- Now support PDF 1.1 (Acrobat 2.x) and PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0).
	- Now support PDF page modes, layouts, and effects, and the
	  first page that is displayed in Acrobat Reader.
	- Now support PostScript Level 3 output with Flate image
	  compression.
	- Now support PostScript commands for page size and duplexing.
	- Now add filenames as needed to HTML links.
	- Added optimizations to output code to further reduce PDF and
	  PostScript file size.
	- Now support alternate 8-bit character sets. Currently we
	  supply data files for the ISO-8859-N character sets.
	- Added chapter headings to the available header/footer
	  formats.
	- The GUI file chooser is significantly improved and supports
	  selection of multiple HTML files.
	- The GUI now provides on-line help.
	- Many other GUI improvements.
	- Added support for DIR and MENU block elements.
	- The header and footer text can now be made boldface, italic,
	  etc.
	- Font settings are now exported to HTML files in a style
	  sheet.
	- Now support page breaks using HTML comments.
	- The image dimensions are now exported to HTML files.
	- Added landscape printing option.
	- Added CAPTION support for tables.
	- Filename links now work for HTML files included in a
	  document.
	- Now support BGCOLOR in tables.

    CHANGES

	- Lots of documentation changes.
	- Much better table formatting.
	- Changed HTML output to use less invasive navigation bars at
	  the top and bottom of each file.  This also means that the
	  "--barcolor" option is no longer supported!
	- Updated to use existing filenames in HTML (directory) output.
	- Now recognize any local PDF file as a local file link (i.e.
	  you just need "HREF=filename.pdf" and not
	  "HREF=file:filename.pdf")
	- <TT>, <CODE>, and <SAMP> no longer reduce the font size.
	- Now put whitespace after image data in PDF files.  This
	  change was needed to work around a bug in Acrobat Reader 4.0.
	- Now generate a complete encoding vector for fonts in PDF
	  files.  This change was needed to work around a bug in all
	  versions of Acrobat Exchange that did not recognize the
	  WinANSI encoding defined in the PDF specifications.
	- Now filter out the BREAK attribute from HR elements.
	- Now only load images once.

    BUG FIXES

	- Wasn't escaping &,<, or > in HTML output
	- Wasn't preserving &nbsp;
	- Links in multi-file HTML output were off-by-one.
	- BLOCKQUOTE needed to be like CENTER and DIV.
	- Needed to use existing link name if present for headings to
	  avoid nested link name bug in Netscape and MSIE.
	- Extremely long link names could cause TOC generation to fail
	  and HTMLDOC to crash.
	- PDF output was not compatible with Ghostscript/Ghostview
	  because Ghostscript does not support inherited page resources
	  or the "Fl" abbreviation for the "FlateDecode" compression
	  filter.
	- PostScript DSC comments didn't have unique page numbers. This
	  caused Ghostview (among others) to get confused.
	- Some functions didn't handle empty text fragments.
	- Images couldn't be scaled both horizontally and vertically.
	- <LI> didn't support the VALUE attribute (but <OL> did...)
	- Fixed whitespace problems before and after some markups that
	  was caused by intervening links.
	- The indexed image output code could generate an image with only
	  1 color index used, which upset Acrobat Reader.
	- Fixed a bug in table-of-contents handling - HTMLDOC would crash
	  on some systems if you converted a web page on the command-line.
	- Wasn't setting the font size and spacing soon enough when
	  generating files on the command-line.
	- Didn't hide EMBED elements when generating indexed HTML files.
	- Didn't always set the current drawing position before drawing
	  a box or line.
	- Base85 encoding of image data was broken for PostScript output.
	- JPEG compression was broken for PostScript output.
	- Didn't set binary mode for the standard output under Windows
	  and OS/2 needed.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.7

	- Added option for overriding the background color or image.
        - Added default font typeface and size options.
	- Added progress indicator for page formatting.
	- The HTMLDOC window is now resizeable.
	- The <TABLE> and <CENTER> markups didn't start a new block.
	- strcasecmp and friends are not available on all platforms.
	- Added support for MacOS (command-line only).
	- The width of table cells could be off by 1 point causing
	  unnecessary text wrapping.
	- The GUI's default center footer wasn't "blank".
	- Images could be "lost" if they reside in the current
	  directory or use an absolute path.
        - Documents without titles or headings could crash HTMLDOC.
	- The image loading code could crash due to a MSVC++ runtime
          library bug.
        - Spacing before <HR>'s wasn't consistent.
	- Buffer overflow problems causing crashes.
	- Didn't accept whitespace in variables, e.g. "<TAG NAME = VALUE>"
	- Links didn't always get propagated.
	- The Flate compressor data was not getting freed, so HTMLDOC
	  could use a lot of memory when compression was enabled.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.6

	- Now support JPEG compression of images.
	- Now have selectable Flate (ZIP) compression level.
	- Now only adjust top and bottom margins if headers and
	  footers are used.
	- Better HTML output support (now remember files for
	  links in multi-file output).
	- Increased maximum page count to 5000.
	- Needed to show headers on all pages in web page mode.
	- Now recognize both "in" and "inch" for measurements.
	- <BR> was not handled properly.
	- Selecting "web page" in the GUI clears the title toggle.
	- TABLE row spacing was not right...
	- <TD COLSPAN=n> now draws multi-column borders.
	- Column widths were computed wrong when COLSPAN was used.
	- Nested lists were not handled right.
	- Internal links didn't work for PDF output.
	- Block spacing should now be more consistent.
	- Image scaling was off - now only use page width so that
	  images are not warped.
        - The footer was always one line too low.
	- Couldn't double-click on input filename to edit.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.5

	- Added customization of headers and footers.
	- Added new "--title" image option.
	- Can now put logo image in header or footer.
	- <MARKUP ID="name"> now works for link destinations.
	- The table of contents now appears as part of the document
	  outline in PDF output.
	- Links to local PDF files are now treated as file links in PDF
	  output instead of web links.
	- You can now turn the title page on/off as desired.
	- PostScript and PDF output to stdout now works.
	- Nested tables now format properly.
	- <HR> now provides horizontal rule; to get a page break use
	  "<HR BREAK>".
        - Fixed <TABLE BORDER=0> bug.
	- Fixed GIF loader bug (caused problems on Alpha machines)
	- No longer get extra line after list items.
	- <FONT> markup nesting now works.
	- "&" by itself would cause loss of 15 characters.
	- The current directory was not tracked properly under Windows.
	- The right, top, and bottom margins were not being saved properly.
	- The htmlReadFile() function could consume too much stack space,
	  causing a program failure.
	- PostScript and PDF files were corrupt when generating a web
	  page with a title page.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.4

	- Now use autoconf "configure" script to build UNIX makefile.
        - Now handle relative filenames a lot better when loading images
	  and files.
	- Added "--webpage" option to support printing of plain HTML
	  files (i.e. not documents with chapters)
	- Added support for document backgrounds in PostScript and PDF
	  output
	- Added "--no-toc" and "--no-title" options to disable the
	  table-of-contents and title pages, respectively
	- PDF files now store all named links for use from a web page
	  (HREF="filename.pdf#name")
        - Converted to C++
	- Now using FLTK for the GUI under UNIX and Windows (yeah, one
	  set of code!)
	- Merged GUI and command-line versions
	- Greatly enhanced GUI now supports nearly all command-line
	  options.
	- Miscellaneous fixes to HTML parsing code
	- PDF links should now go to the right page all the time
	- Fixed DSC comments in PostScript output to conform to the

	  MSVC++ runtime libraries!)
	- <PRE> inside a list didn't work
	- parse_table() and friends didn't check for a NULL parent
	  pointer.
	- Paragraph text that wasn't enclosed by P markups was
	  located on the wrong page when followed by a H1 markup.

CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.3.1

	- Fixed font encoding vector in PostScript output (minus instead
	  of hyphen for '-' character).


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.3

        - New GUI for managing documents (Windows + X11/Motif)
	- Better table printing with support for user-specified column
	  widths and better automatic-sizing
        - PNG loading now works when grayscale output is requested
	- No image optimization was performed in PDF or Level 2 PostScript
	  files.  HTMLDOC now converts images to indexed (1,2,4,8 bits) if
	  there is an advantage (fewer bits per pixel) and no loss of color
	  would occur
	- The filenames in links were getting lost when writing indexed
	  HTML to a directory
	- The logo image filename wasn't being localized when writing
	  indexed HTML to a directory
	- Fonts, images, and links weren't supported inside a PRE tag
	- Added support for the <!DOCTYPE> markup
	- No longer assume that chars are unsigned by default
	- Invalid or missing links no longer generate bad PDF files
	- External links (http:, ftp:, etc) now work
	- Escaped characters are now decoded correctly in the table of
	  contents in PDF files
	- Image scaling is now more intelligent


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.2

        - Now support "internal" links in a document (PDF & HTML).
        - Added "no compression" option for PDF files; this is needed for
          older PDF readers like Acroread 2.x.
        - Much better parsing of HTML; should now work very well with the
          HTML output by Netscape Composer.
        - Wasn't opening image files in "binary" mode (Windows).
        - The htmlReadString() and htmlWriteString() functions were removed
          because of portability problems to HP-UX and Windows, among others.


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.1

        - Ordered (numbered) lists are now supported, as are the TYPE=, START=,
          and VALUE= option variables.
        - Now support coverpages for PS and PDF output with optional logo image.
        - Running headings (at the bottom of PS/PDF pages) are now tracked
          correctly.
        - Fixed parsing of lists so lists generated by Netscape Composer work
          right...
        - Fixed HTML links when generating a single HTML file.
        - The --numbered option didn't number all headings (only those in the
          table-of-contents).


CHANGES IN HTMLDOC v1.0

        - Initial version.
