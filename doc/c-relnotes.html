<P>This appendix provides the release notes for each version of <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.19</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Now support the "subject" meta variable.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Updated the HTML parser to use HTML 4.0 rules for
	embedding elements inside a LI.</LI>

	<LI>Now check for a TYPE attribute on EMBED elements, so
	that embedded Flash files do not get treated as HTML.</LI>

	<LI>Now put the COPYRIGHT meta data in the Author field in
	a PDF file along with the AUTHOR meta data (if any).</LI>

	<LI>No longer embed the prolog.ps command header when
	PostScript commands are not being embedded in the
	output.</LI>

	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> now properly ignores the HTML 4.0 COL element.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Squeezed tables were not centered or right-aligned
	properly.</LI>

	<LI>Cells didn't align properly if they were the first
	things on the page, or if there were several
	intervening empty cells.</LI>

	<LI>The preferred cell width handling didn't account for
	the minimum cell width, which could cause some tables
	to become too large.</LI>

	<LI>Remote URLs didn't always resolve properly (like the
	images from the Google web page...)</LI>

	<LI>The font width loading code didn't force the
	non-breaking space to have the same width as a regular
	space.</LI>

	<LI>PRE text didn't adjust the line height for the tallest
	fragment in the line.</LI>

	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> tried to seek backwards when reading HTML
	from the standard input.</LI>

	<LI>The media margin comments did not work properly when
	the current media orientation was landscape.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.18</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added support for remote HTML title pages.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Now accept all JPEG files, even if they don't start
	with an APPn marker.</LI>

	<LI>Now only start a new page for a chapter/filter if we
	aren't already at the top of a page.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>ROWSPAN handling in tables has been updated to match
	the MSIE behavior, where the current rowspan is
	reduced by the minimum rowspan in the table; that is,
	if you use "ROWSPAN=17" for all cells in a row,
	<I>HTMLDOC</I> now treats this as if you did not use ROWSPAN
	at all.  It is unclear if this is what the W3C
	intends.</LI>

	<LI>The "--webpage" option didn't force toc levels to 0,
	which caused a bad page object reference to be
	inserted in the PDF output file.</LI>

	<LI>Background colors in nested tables didn't always get
	drawn in the right order, resulting in the wrong
	colors showing through.</LI>

	<LI>The HEADER page comment didn't set the correct top
	position in landscape orientation.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.17</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Improved table-of-contents generation, with chapter
	headings at the top of new TOC pages and page numbers
	based on the header/footer string.</LI>

	<LI>Added new "--no-localfiles" option to disable access
	to local files for added security in web services.</LI>

	<LI>Long lines in book files can not be broken up using
	a trailing backslash.</LI>

	<LI>Added a modern "skin" to the GUI interface.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Made some changes in how COLSPAN and ROWSPAN are
	handled to better match how Netscape and MSIE format
	things.</LI>
	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> now handles .book files with CR, LF, or CR LF
	line endings.</LI>
	<LI>Changed the TOC numbering to use 32-bit integers
	instead of 8-bit integers...</LI>
	<LI>Now handle local links with quoted (%HH) characters.</LI>
	<LI>The command-line interface no longer sets PDF output
	mode when using --continuous or --webpage.</LI>
	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> now opens HTML output files in binary mode to
	prevent extra CR's under Windows, and strips incoming
	CR's from PRE text.</LI>
	<LI>Now support inserting the current chapter and heading
	in the table-of-contents headers and footers.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The table cell border and background were offset by
	the cellpadding when they should only be offset by the
	cellspacing.</LI>
	<LI>The buffer used for periods that lead up to the page
	number in the table-of-contents was not large enough
	for a legal-size document in landscape format.</LI>
	<LI>If a book only contained chapter headings, the PDF
	bookmarks would be missing the last chapter heading.</LI>
	<LI>Table cells that ended with a break would render
	incorrectly.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed the table pre-format sizing code to properly
	account for borders, padding, etc.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed the table squeezing code to honor minimum widths
	and properly resize the remaining space.</LI>
	<LI>The MEDIA SIZE page comment did not reset the printable
	width and length of the page.</LI>
	<LI>Tables that used COLSPAN did not honor WIDTH values in
	non-spanned cells.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.16</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Now break before and after DIV groups to match most
	browsers (the HTML spec is ambivalent about it...)</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>HR elements didn't render properly.</LI>
	<LI>Background images didn't render properly and could
	lock up <I>HTMLDOC</I>.</LI>
	<LI>The "HALF PAGE" comment would lock up <I>HTMLDOC</I> -
	<I>HTMLDOC</I> would keep adding pages until it ran out of
	memory.</LI>
	<LI>SUP and SUB used a fixed (reduced) size instead of
	using a smaller size from the current one.</LI>
	<LI>Empty cells could cause unnecessary vertical alignment
	on the same row.</LI>

</UL>


<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.15</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Now support media source, type, and color attributes
	in PS output.</LI>
	<LI>Now support per-page size, margins, headers, footers,
	orientation, and duplexing.</LI>
	<LI>Now support plain text for headers and footers, with $
	variables to include page numbers and so forth.</LI>
	<LI>New device control prolog file for printer-specific
	option commands.</LI>
	<LI>Now support a new continuous web page mode that
	doesn't automatically insert a page break with each
	HTML file or URL (--continuous).</LI>
	<LI>Now draw border around inline images as needed.</LI>
	<LI>Now support MacOS X (only command-line at present).</LI>
	<LI>Now support the "page-break-before", "text-align",
	"vertical-align" style attributes, but only for style
	information in an element's STYLE attribute.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Now load images into memory only as needed, and unload
	them when no longer needed.  This provides a dramatic
	reduction in memory usage with files that contain a
	lot of in-line images.</LI>
	<LI>Now use the long names for the Flate and DCT filters
	in all non-inline PDF streams.  This avoids a stupid
	bug in Acrobat Reader when printing to PostScript
	printers.</LI>
	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> now strips any trailing GET query information
	when saving the start of files (target) in a document.</LI>
	<LI>Unqualified URLs (no leading scheme name, e.g. http:)
	now default to the HTTP port (80) instead of the IPP
	port (631).</LI>
	<LI>Optimized the image writing code to do more efficient
	color searching.  This provides a significant speed
	improvement when including images.</LI>
	<LI>Now hide all text inside SCRIPT, SELECT, and TEXTAREA
	elements.</LI>
	<LI>OS/2 port changes from Alexander Mai.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>If a document started with a heading greater than H1,
	<I>HTMLDOC</I> would crash.</LI>
	<LI>Full justification would incorrectly be applied to
	text ending with a break.</LI>
	<LI>Images using ALIGN="MIDDLE" were not centered properly
	on the baseline.</LI>
	<LI>Table cells that used both ROWSPAN and COLSPAN did not
	format properly (the colspan was lost after the first
	row.)</LI>
	<LI>Tables that used cells that exclusively used COLSPAN
	did not format properly.</LI>
	<LI>When writing HTML output, image references would
	incorrectly be mapped using the current path.</LI>
	<LI>Images with a width or height of 0 should not be
	written to PS or PDF output.</LI>
	<LI>The CreationDate comment in PostScript output
	contained a bad timezone offset (+-0500, for example,
	instead of -0500).</LI>
	<LI>The PHP portal example now verifies that the URL
	passed to it contains no illegal characters.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.14</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added support for 128-bit encryption.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for GET form request data in the PHP and
	Java "portal" examples.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Most output generation limits have been removed;
	<I>HTMLDOC</I> now dynamically allocates memory as needed for
	pages, images, headings, and links.  This has the
	happy side-effect of reducing the initial memory
	footprint significantly.</LI>
	<LI>Now call setlocale() when it is available to localize
	the date and time in the output.</LI>
	<LI>The table parsing code now checks to see that a
	ROWSPAN attribute fits in the table; e.g., a ROWSPAN
	of 10 for a table that has only 6 rows remaining needs
	to be reduced to 6...</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Tables with a lot of COLSPANs could cause a divide-
	by-zero error or bad pages (NAN instead of a number.)</LI>
	<LI>Table cells with a single render element would not be
	vertically aligned.</LI>
	<LI>The --quiet option would enable progress messages on
	the command-line.</LI>
	<LI>Table cell widths could be computed incorrectly,
	causing unnecessary wrapping.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.13</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added support for secure (https) URLs via the
	OpenSSL library.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4).</LI>
	<LI>Added support for transparency in PostScript and
	PDF 1.1 and 1.2 output.</LI>
	<LI>Added a --no-jpeg option (same as --jpeg=0)</LI>
	<LI>Added support for the CSS2 page-break-before and
	page-break-after properties.</LI>
	<LI>Added a PHP example.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>External file references to non-PDF files now use the
	"Launch" action so they can be opened/executed/saved
	as allowed by the OS and PDF viewer.</LI>
	<LI>Changed the indexed/JPEG'd transition point to 256
	colors when using Flate compression.  This makes PDF
	files much smaller in general.</LI>
	<LI>Changed the in-line image size limit to 64k.</LI>
	<LI>Now allow "&lt;" followed by whitespace, "=", or "&lt;". 
	This violates the HTML specification, but we're sick
	of people complaining about it.</LI>
	<LI>Preferences are now stored in a user-specific file
	under Windows, just like UNIX.  This provides
	user-specific preferences and allows preferences to
	be kept when upgrading to new versions of <I>HTMLDOC</I>.</LI>
	<LI>The book loading code now allows for blank lines, even
	though these are not a part of the format. (added to
	support some scripted apps that include extra
	newlines...)</LI>
	<LI>Changed the leading space handling of blocks to more
	closely match the standard browser behavior.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The table formatting code adding the border width to
	the cell width, while Netscape and MSIE don't.  This
	caused some interesting formatting glitches...</LI>
	<LI>The table formatting code didn't account for the
	preferred width of colspan'd cells.</LI>
	<LI>The table formatting code tried to enforce the
	minimum cell width when squeezing a table to fit on
	the page; this caused the table to still exceed the
	width of the page.</LI>
	<LI>The PDF catalog object could contain a reference to
	a /Names object of "0 0 R", which is invalid.  This
	would happen when the "--no-links" option was used.</LI>
	<LI>Several HTML elements were incorrectly written with
	closing tags.</LI>
	<LI>When piping PDF output, the temporary file that is
	created needed to be open for reading and writing,
	but <I>HTMLDOC</I> only opened the file for writing.</LI>
	<LI>Image links did not work.</LI>
	<LI>The JPEG image loading code did not correctly handle
	grayscale JPEG images.</LI>
	<LI>JPEG images were not encrypted when writing a document
	with encryption enabled.</LI>
	<LI>The user password was not properly encrypted.</LI>
	<LI>The colormap of indexed images were not encrypted when
	writing a document with encryption enabled.</LI>
	<LI>The temporary file creation and cleanup functions did
	not use the same template under Windows, causing
	multiple conversions to fail when temporary files were
	used.</LI>
	<LI>Paragraphs could end up with one extra text fragment,
	causing the line to be too long.</LI>
	<LI>The command-line program would clear the error count
	after reading all the files/URLs on the command-line,
	but before generating the document. If there were
	problems reading the files/URLs, <I>HTMLDOC</I> would return a
	0 exit status instead of 1.</LI>
	<LI>Image objects that were both JPEG and Flate compressed
	would not display (filters specified in the wrong
	order.)</LI>
	<LI>Images with more than 256 colors would cause a segfault
	on some systems.</LI>
	<LI>Background images would generate the error message
	"XObject 'Innn' is unknown".</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.12</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added new "--batch" option to convert <I>HTMLDOC</I> book
	files from the command-line.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for the "-display" option on systems
	that use X11.</LI>
	<LI>Now use image objects in PDF output for images when
	the image width * height * depth > 32k.</LI>
	<LI>Now use JPEG compression when the number of colors
	would be > 32 colors or 16 gray shades.</LI>
	<LI>True transparency support for GIF files in PDF 1.3
	output!</LI>
	<LI>The GUI now automatically changes the extension of the
	output filename as needed.</LI>
	<LI>The GUI now collects all error messages and shows them
	once after the document is generated.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for HSPACE and VSPACE attributes for images
	with ALIGN="LEFT" or ALIGN="RIGHT".</LI>
	<LI>Added new Java interface to <I>HTMLDOC</I>.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Consolidated temporary file management into new
	file_temp() function.  The new function also makes use
	of the Windows "short lived" open option which may
	improve performance with small temporary files.</LI>
	<LI>Updated book file format and added an appendix
	describing the format.</LI>
	<LI>Now default to PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0) output format.</LI>
	<LI>Now output length of PDF streams with the stream
	object; this offers a modest reduction in file size.</LI>
	<LI>The HTTP file cache now keeps track of previous URLs
	that were downloaded.</LI>
	<LI>The HTTP code now supports redirections (status codes
	301 to 303) to alternate URLs.</LI>
	<LI>Limit the height check for table rows to 1/8th of the
	page length; this seems to provide fairly consistent
	wrapping of tables without leaving huge expanses of
	blank space at the bottom of pages.</LI>
	<LI>The HTML output now also includes a font-family style
	for PRE text; otherwise the body font would override
	the PRE font with some browsers.</LI>
	<LI>The snprintf/vsnprintf emulation functions were not
	included in the <I>HTMLDOC</I> makefile.</LI>
	<LI>RGB hex colors are now recognized with or without the
	leading #. This breaks HTML standards compliance but
	should reduce the number of problem reports from buggy
	HTML.</LI>
	<LI>The stylesheet generated with the HTML output no longer
	contains absolute font sizes, just the typefaces and
	a relative size for SUB/SUP.</LI>
	<LI>The title image is no longer scaled to 100% in the
	HTML output.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The web page output was not divided into chapters for
	each input file.</LI>
	<LI>The "make install" target did a clean.</LI>
	<LI>The configure script would remove the image libraries
	if you did not have FLTK installed.</LI>
	<LI>The fix_filename() function didn't handle relative
	URLs for images (e.g. SRC="../images/filename.gif")</LI>
	<LI>Comments in the source document were being closed by
	a </!--> tag in the HTML output.</LI>
	<LI>The alignment attribute in TR elements was not inherited
	by the TD and TH elements.</LI>
	<LI>The HTML parser added whitespace before the title of a
	document (missing check for TITLE element.)</LI>
	<LI>The table formatter did not reset the column width when
	a width was not specified explicitly.  This caused the
	columns to be formatted with equal widths...</LI>
	<LI>Paragraphs that didn't use the P element would use the
	alignment attribute of the first fragment instead of the
	parent.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.11</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added koi8-r character set.</LI>
	<LI>Added new "TrueType" font option for PDF output. This
	(hopefully) should improve support for non-latin
	languages.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for "justify" alignment; this is
	currently implemented by adding additional space
	between characters (no automatic hyphenation...)</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>The "make install" target does a "make all" to ensure
	that the software is built before installing it.  This
	should help users that don't read the documentation
	build the software.</LI>
	<LI>Incorporated several OS/2 compile fixes from Alexander
	Mai.</LI>
	<LI>Tables that exceed the printable width of the page are
	now squeezed to fit.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The temporary file created for PDF output to stdout
	was not unique.</LI>
	<LI>The temporary file created for PDF output to stdout
	did not use the GetTempPath() function under Windows.</LI>
	<LI>The temporary file cleanup code did not use the
	GetTempPath() function under Windows.</LI>
	<LI>The prefs_load() function did not check the
	HTMLDOC_DATA environment variable until after loading
	the preferences file.  This could cause any saved
	settings to generate error messages about missing
	files (these were reloaded when the document data was
	read, however.)</LI>
	<LI>The first border for a table cell that spanned
	multiple pages did not account for the cellpadding or
	border width.</LI>
	<LI>Leading whitespace was not eliminated in all cases.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.10</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>New "--quiet" option to suppress all messages sent to
	stderr.</LI>
	<LI>New chapter n/N page number format (:)</LI>
	<LI>New "--links" and "--no-links" options for PDF output.</LI>
	<LI>Added "&euro;" character name support.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Documentation updates.</LI>
	<LI>If a heading already contains a link, the name assigned for
	the heading is stored in the existing link to avoid nested
	links.</LI>
	<LI>The table parsing code now also traverses THEAD and TFOOT
	sections and handles multiple TBODY, THEAD, and TFOOT
	sections.  The THEAD and TFOOT rows are treated as ordinary
	rows.</LI>
	<LI>Image alignment should now match W3C recommendations.</LI>
	<LI>Newlines inside quoted values (e.g. SRC="filename\r\n")
	are now ignored.</LI>
	<LI>The STYLE data generated in HTML output now includes the
	TYPE="text/css" attribute.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The path support was still broken.</LI>
	<LI>Embedded files and images did not use path or HTTP
	support.</LI>
	<LI>Table cell borders could be drawn on the wrong page
	if not all cells in a row span more than one page.</LI>
	<LI>Large images could end up covering the footer at the
	bottom of the page (wasn't accounting for the line
	spacing.)</LI>
	<LI>Fixed some memory leaks that would affect Windows
	95/98/Me users.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.9</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added a "--no-numbered" option to turn heading numbers
	off.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for "keywords" META data.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for BMP images.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for ROWSPAN attribute in tables.</LI>
	<LI>Added support for HTTP file references.</LI>
	<LI>Added new sample CGI program that can produce a PDF
	file for any page on a server.</LI>
	<LI>Added new n/N, date, and time formats for the header
	and footer.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Configuration script changes.</LI>
	<LI>Now ignore file count in book files; instead, we now
	look at the first character of the third and
	subsequent lines - a dash (-) indicates the start of
	the options. (use a backslash to quote filenames
	starting with a dash)</LI>
	<LI>Multiple-line paragraphs that have only 1 line on the
	bottom of the current page are now started on the
	following page.</LI>
	<LI>DSC comments in PostScript output were not 100%
	conformant with the DSC spec.</LI>
	<LI>Long table-of-contents entries are now wrapped
	(original patch supplied by Richard Pennington)</LI>
	<LI>New color icon under UNIX when Xpm library available.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Didn't allow &amp;#nnn; character escapes inside
	preformatted text.</LI>
	<LI>Empty TBODY groups would cause parse_table() to
	crash.</LI>
	<LI>Comments were incorrectly terminated by ">" instead of
	"-->".</LI>
	<LI>The command-line and GUI interfaces looked for
	"outlines" instead of "outline" for the page mode.</LI>
	<LI>The HTML output code didn't output closing tags for
	empty elements.</LI>
	<LI>The GUI interface started with the compression
	slider enabled, even for HTML output.</LI>
	<LI>The beginnings of some lines could start with
	whitespace.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't aligning images and text on lines based on the
	line height.</LI>
	<LI>The compression slider was enabled in the GUI even
	though HTML output was selected.</LI>
	<LI>The Perl example code was incorrect.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed the check for whether or not pages were
	generated.</LI>
	<LI>htmlSetCharSet() wasn't reloading the character set
	data if the data directory changed.</LI>
	<LI>The GUI did not reset the default background color.</LI>
	<LI>The 'C' page number style (chapter page numbers) started
	at 3 instead of 1.</LI>
	<LI>The chapter links were off by 1 or 2 pages when no title
	page was included.</LI>

</UL>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Added support for PDF security/encryption!</LI>
	<LI>Now support TABLE height attribute.</LI>
	<LI>Now generate an error message if no pages are
	generated (with a suggestion to use the webpage
	option.)</LI>
	<LI>New "paths" option to specify additional directories
	to search for files.  This is useful when the source
	files use absolute server paths.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Added missing casts in htmllib.cxx that were causing a
	compile warning with some compilers.</LI>
	<LI>No longer draw borders around empty cells in tables...</LI>
	<LI>Now disable the TOC tab when using webpage mode.</LI>
	<LI>Now scale title image to 100% in HTML output.</LI>
	<LI>Now handle comments with missing whitespace after the
	"&lt;!--".</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Nested tables didn't take into account the table
	border width, spacing, or padding values.</LI>
	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> crashed under Solaris when reading HTML files
	from the standard input.</LI>
	<LI>&lt;ELEM&gt;text&lt;/ELEM&gt;
	&lt;MELE&gt;text&lt;/MELE&gt; was rendered without an
	intervening space.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.7</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>The configure script now uses the local PNG, ZLIB,
	and/or JPEG libraries when they are new enough.</LI>
	<LI>The configure script now uses the -fno-rtti,
	-fno-exceptions, and -fpermissive options as needed
	with GCC (smaller, faster executables, works around X
	header bugs in Solaris.)</LI>
	<LI>Added a --toctitle option to set the table-of-contents
	title from the command-line (was only available in the
	GUI in previous releases...)</LI>
	<LI>New "&lt;!-- NEED amount -->" comment to force a page
	feed if there is not sufficient room on the page for
	the following text.</LI>
	<LI>Page comments are now supported in tables.</LI>
	<LI>Table rows are now allocated dynamically, MAX_ROWS at
	a time.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Increased default MAX_PAGES to 10000 (was 5000.)</LI>
	<LI>File links in book files now point to the top of the
	next page.</LI>
	<LI>&lt;TABLE ALIGN=xyz> now aligns the table (previously it
	just set the default alignment of cells.)</LI>
	<LI>Transparent GIFs now use the body color instead of white
	for the transparent color.</LI>
	<LI>Updated to LIBPNG 1.0.6 in source distribution.</LI>
	<LI>Updated the default cellpadding to be 1 pixel to match
	Netscape output.</LI>
	<LI>Updated line and block spacing to match Netscape.</LI>
	<LI>DL/DT/DD output now matches browsers (was indented from
	browser output.)</LI>
	<LI>Now only output link (A) style if it is set to "none".
	Otherwise Netscape would underline all targets as well
	as links.</LI>
	<LI>Increased the MAX_COLUMNS constant to 200, and dropped
	MAX_ROWS to 200. Note that the new table code now
	allocates rows in increments of MAX_ROWS rows, so the
	actual maximum number of rows depends on available
	memory.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Now ignore illegal HTML in tables.</LI>
	<LI>The VALIGN code didn't handle empty cells properly.
	<LI>Wasn't offsetting the start of each row by the cell
	padding.</LI>
	<LI>The JPEG image loading code didn't work for some JPEG
	images, particularly those from digital cameras (JPEG
	but not JFIF format.)</LI>
	<LI>The strikethrough line was not being drawn in the
	correct position.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't setting the height of BR elements, so &lt;BR>&lt;BR>
	didn't insert a blank line.</LI>
	<LI>The table of contents would show the wrong page numbers
	if no title page was generated.</LI>
	<LI>Cell widths did not subtract any border, padding, or
	spacing from the "preferred" width, causing formatting
	differences between web browsers and <I>HTMLDOC</I>.</LI>
	<LI>The PNG loading code did not handle interlacing or
	transparency.</LI>
	<LI>The HTML parsing code did not prevent elements in
	embedded files from completing elements in the parent
	file.</LI>
	<LI>The table CELLSPACING amount was being applied twice in
	the table sizing calculations.</LI>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.6</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>New linkcolor and linkstyle options.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Minor source changes for OS/2 compilation.</LI>
	<LI>SUP and SUB now raise/lower text more to be consistent with
	browser look-n-feel.</LI>
	<LI>Non-breaking space by itself was being output.  Now check for
	that and ignore strings that consist entirely of whitespace.</LI>
	<LI>New progress bar.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Didn't add whitespace after a table caption.</LI>
	<LI>Nested tables caused formatting problems (flatten_tree()
	didn't insert breaks for new rows)</LI>
	<LI>A cell whose minimum width exceeded the available width
	for the table would cause the table to go off the page.</LI>
	<LI>Cells that spanned more than two pages were drawn with boxes
	around them rather than just the sides.</LI>
	<LI>The stylesheet info in the HTML output specified the H1 size
	for all headings.</LI>
	<LI>The title page was incorrectly formatted when an image was
	specified - the text start position was computed using the
	pixel height of the title image and not the formatted height.</LI>
	<LI>1 color images didn't come out right; the "fix" to work around
	an Acrobat Reader bug was being done too soon, so the color
	lookups were wrong.</LI>
	<LI>HTML file links now work properly.</LI>
	<LI>Now limit all HTML input to the maximum size of input buffers
	to avoid potential buffer overflow problems in CGIs.</LI>
	<LI>If a row had a predefined height, <I>HTMLDOC</I> wasn't making sure
	that the row would fit on the current page.</LI>
	<LI>THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY caused problems when formatting tables.
	Note: THEAD and TFOOT are *still* not supported, however the
	code now properly ignores them and parses the rows in the
	TBODY group.</LI>
	<LI>The VALIGN code introduced in the 1.8.5 release didn't check
	for NULL pointers in all cases.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.5</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>New "--titlefile" option to include an HTML file for
	the title page(s).</LI>

	number within chapter or HTML file.</LI>
	<LI>Allow adding of .book files to import all HTML files
	in the book.</LI>
	<LI>New "HALF PAGE" page comment to feed 1/2 page.</LI>
	<LI>Added VALIGN and HEIGHT support in tables.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Now optimize link objects in PDF files (provides a 40k
	reduction in file size for the <I>HTMLDOC</I> manual alone)</LI>
	<LI>Table rows that cross page boundaries are now rendered
	more like Netscape and MSIE.</LI>
	<LI>Now support HTMLDOC_DATA and HTMLDOC_HELP environment
	variables under UNIX (for alternate install directory)</LI>
	<LI>Now show error messages when <I>HTMLDOC</I> can't open the
	AFM, character set, or PostScript glyph files.</LI>
	<LI>The logo image is now scaled to its "natural" size (as
	it would appear in a web browser)</LI>
	<LI>Now recognize VALIGN="MIDDLE" or VALIGN="CENTER".</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Generation of PDF files to the standard output (i.e.
	to the web server + browser) didn't work on some
	versions of UNIX.  <I>HTMLDOC</I> now writes the PDF output
	to a temporary file and then copies it to the standard
	output as needed.</LI>
	<LI>PDF links were missing the first 5 characters in the
	filename; the code was trying to skip over the "file:"
	prefix, but that prefix was already skipped elsewhere.</LI>
	<LI>Nested descriptive lists (DL) did not get rendered
	properly.</LI>
	<LI>Tables had extra whitespace before and after them.</LI>
	<LI>Multiple aligned images confused parse_paragraph();
	the images would overlap instead of stack on the
	sides.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.4</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>More configure script changes for FLTK DSOs.</LI>
	<LI>FileIcon.cxx was still using NULL for outline (an
	integer), which caused some ANSI C++ compilers to
	complain.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>The Fonts and Colors tab groups did not extend to
	the full width of the tab area, which prevented the
	Browse button from working when clicked on the right
	side.</LI>
	<LI>The help dialog window did not scroll all the way to
	the bottom of the text.</LI>
	<LI>The chapter ("c") header/footer string did not work.</LI>
	<LI>The heading ("h") header/footer string did not always
	match the first heading on a page.</LI>
	<LI>The header and footer fonts were not used when
	computing the widths of the header and footer strings.</LI>
	<LI>The Windows distribution did not create the right
	shortcut for the Users Manual in the Start menu.</LI>
	<LI>The command-line code did not accept "--grayscale",
	only "--gray"</LI>
	<LI>Multi-file HTML output did not use the right link for
	the table-of-contents file if no title page was being
	generated.</LI>
	<LI>Extra whitespace before and after tables has been
	eliminated.</LI>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>New "--browserwidth" option to control scaling of images and
	tables that use fixed pixel widths.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>The configure script now looks for the OpenGL library
	(required if you use a shared FLTK library with OpenGL
	support.)</LI>
	<LI>Increased the max number of chapters to 1000.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Page break comments didn't force a paragraph break.</LI>
	<LI>--no-toc prevented chapters from being output in PS
	and PDF files.</LI>
	<LI>Filenames didn't always get updated properly when doing a
	"save as"...</LI>
	<LI>Fixed some more leading/trailing whitespace problems.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't freeing page headings after the document was
	generated.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't range checking the current chapter number; now
	limits the number of chapters to MAX_CHAPTERS and
	issues an error message whenever the limit is exceeded.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.2</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>New "setup" program for UNIX software installation.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Documentation updated for new UNIX "setup" program and
	"..." usage for headers and footers.</LI>
	<LI>Changed margins to floating point (instead of integer) to
	improve table column accuracy.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI><I>HTMLDOC</I> could crash under Microsoft Windows with some
	types of HTML files.  This was caused by a stack overflow,
	usually when processing nested tables.</LI>
	<LI>Multiple HTML files weren't being converted properly in
	web page mode - only the last file would be generated for
	PostScript output, and no file for PDF output.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't preserving the whitespace between "one" and "two"
	in the HTML code "one&lt;I> two&lt;/I> three".</LI>
	<LI>Paragraph spacing was inconsistent.</LI>
	<LI>&lt;TABLE WIDTH="xx"> wasn't formatted properly.</LI>
	<LI>The command-line code wasn't opening HTML files in binary
	mode. This caused problems under Microsoft Windows.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8.1</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>The configure script didn't update the ARFLAGS
	variable for *BSD operating systems (no "s" option to
	build the symbol table...)</LI>
	<LI>Changed the installation commands to only create the
	installation directory if it does not exist.  This
	prevents installation errors on some platforms the
	second time around.</LI>
	<LI>Now use the Microsoft definitions for characters 128
	through 159 that are otherwise unused by the
	ISO-8859-x character sets.</LI>
	<LI>Now set optimization settings when we know the compiler.</LI>
	<LI>Now always quote attribute values in HTML output to make
	HTML lint programs happy.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Wasn't using TOC title string in PDF document outline.</LI>
	<LI>Preformatted text in tables didn't force the column
	width.</LI>
	<LI>Cells using COLSPAN > 1 didn't contribute to the width
	of columns.</LI>
	<LI>The table code didn't enforce the per-column minimums
	under certain circumstances, causing "scrambled"
	columns.</LI>
	<LI>The configure script and makefiles didn't work when
	FLTK was not available.  They now only build the "gui"
	library when it is available.</LI>
	<LI>The Windows distribution was installing files under
	PROGRAMDIR instead of TARGETDIR.  This prevented users
	from customizing the installation directory.</LI>
	<LI>The configure script overrode the LDFLAGS environment
	variable, preventing FLTK from being located in a non-
	default directory.</LI>

</UL>

<H2>Changes in HTMLDOC v1.8</H2>

<UL>

	<H3>New Features</H3>

	<LI>Now support PDF 1.1 (Acrobat 2.x) and PDF 1.3 (Acrobat 4.0).</LI>

	compression.</LI>
	<LI>Now support PostScript commands for page size and duplexing.
	<LI>Now add filenames as needed to HTML links.</LI>
	<LI>Added optimizations to output code to further reduce PDF and
	PostScript file size.</LI>
	<LI>Now support alternate 8-bit character sets. Currently we
	supply data files for the ISO-8859-N character sets.</LI>
	<LI>Added chapter headings to the available header/footer
	formats.</LI>
	<LI>The GUI file chooser is significantly improved and supports

	<LI>Added CAPTION support for tables.</LI>
	<LI>Filename links now work for HTML files included in a
	document.</LI>
	<LI>Now support BGCOLOR in tables.</LI>

	<H3>Changes</H3>

	<LI>Lots of documentation changes.</LI>
	<LI>Much better table formatting.</LI>
	<LI>Changed HTML output to use less invasive navigation bars at
	the top and bottom of each file.  This also means that the
	"--barcolor" option is no longer supported!</LI>
	<LI>Updated to use existing filenames in HTML (directory) output.
	<LI>Now recognize any local PDF file as a local file link (i.e.
	you just need "HREF=filename.pdf" and not
	"HREF=file:filename.pdf")</LI>
	<LI>&lt;TT>, &lt;CODE>, and &lt;SAMP> no longer reduce the font size.</LI>
	<LI>Now put whitespace after image data in PDF files.  This
	change was needed to work around a bug in Acrobat Reader 4.0.</LI>
	<LI>Now generate a complete encoding vector for fonts in PDF
	files.  This change was needed to work around a bug in all
	versions of Acrobat Exchange that did not recognize the
	WinANSI encoding defined in the PDF specifications.</LI>
	<LI>Now filter out the BREAK attribute from HR elements.</LI>
	<LI>Now only load images once.</LI>

	<H3>Bug Fixes</H3>

	<LI>Wasn't escaping &amp;,&lt;, or > in HTML output</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't preserving &amp;nbsp;</LI>
	<LI>Links in multi-file HTML output were off-by-one.</LI>
	<LI>BLOCKQUOTE needed to be like CENTER and DIV.</LI>
	<LI>Needed to use existing link name if present for headings to
	avoid nested link name bug in Netscape and MSIE.</LI>
	<LI>Extremely long link names could cause TOC generation to fail
	and <I>HTMLDOC</I> to crash.</LI>
	<LI>PDF output was not compatible with Ghostscript/Ghostview
	because Ghostscript does not support inherited page resources
	or the "Fl" abbreviation for the "FlateDecode" compression
	filter.</LI>
	<LI>PostScript DSC comments didn't have unique page numbers. This
	caused Ghostview (among others) to get confused.</LI>
	<LI>Some functions didn't handle empty text fragments.</LI>
	<LI>Images couldn't be scaled both horizontally and vertically.</LI>
	<LI>&lt;LI> didn't support the VALUE attribute (but &lt;OL> did...)</LI>
	<LI>Fixed whitespace problems before and after some markups that
	was caused by intervening links.</LI>
	<LI>The indexed image output code could generate an image with only
	1 color index used, which upset Acrobat Reader.</LI>
	<LI>Fixed a bug in table-of-contents handling - <I>HTMLDOC</I> would crash
	on some systems if you converted a web page on the command-line.</LI>
	<LI>Wasn't setting the font size and spacing soon enough when
	generating files on the command-line.</LI>
	<LI>Didn't hide EMBED elements when generating indexed HTML files.</LI>
	<LI>Didn't always set the current drawing position before drawing
	a box or line.</LI>
	<LI>Base85 encoding of image data was broken for PostScript output.</LI>
	<LI>JPEG compression was broken for PostScript output.</LI>
	<LI>Didn't set binary mode for the standard output under Windows
	and OS/2 needed.</LI>
